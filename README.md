2. Timers at intervals.
3. Dynamically updating the HTML using javascript and jquery at predetermined times
4. Use of select from the options forms

### To Create One of Your Own

1. Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3. Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5. Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

   * In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
   * In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
   * In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

6. Choose a game to build of your own with functionality from below. 

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
